better readMe coming after I learn markdown. sorry. To use: first host a server by running main.py, entering "host", and entering your local ip address and a port number. Then have your friends connect by running main.py, entering "connect", and entering your public ip address (or local if you're on a LAN) and the same port number. As a host, join your own server by opening another terminal window and connecting like everyone else. Once everyone joins, type "start" into the host terminal window (it's promting you for input) and the game will start. Don't disconnect in the middle of the game plz.
